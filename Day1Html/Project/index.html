         <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
         <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement of the C language to add object-oriented paradigm. It is a high-level programming language that was first released in 1985 and since then has become the foundation of many modern technologies like game engines, web browsers, operating systems, financial systems, etc.</p>
         <h3>Features of C++</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library support and a variety of datatypes.</li>
            <li>Machine Independent: C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a suitable compiler is provided.</li>
            <li>Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.</li>
            <li>Fast Execution Speed: C++ is one of the fastest high-level languages. There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast.</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications can be built.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
        <pre style="background-color: aquamarine;">
            <code>
               #include &lt;iostream&gt;
               using namespace std;

                int main() {
                    cout << "Hello, World!"<< endl;
                    return 0;
              } 
            </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Header File: The header files contain the definition of the functions and macros we are using in our program. In line #1, we used the #include  <iostream> statement to tell the compiler to include an iostream header file library which stores the definition of the cin and cout standard input/output streams that we have used for input and output. #include is a preprocessor directive using which we import header files.</li>
            <li>Namespace: A namespace in C++ is used to provide a scope or a region where we define identifiers. In line #2, we have used the using namespace std statement for specifying that we will be the standard namespace where all the standard library functions are defined.</li>
            <li>Main Function: In line #3, we defined the main function as int main(). The main function is the most important part of any C++ program. The program execution always starts from the main function. All the other functions are called from the main function. In C++, the main function is required to return some value indicating the execution status.</li>
            <li>Blocks: Blocks are the group of statements that are enclosed within { } braces. The body of the main function is from line #4 to line #9 enclosed within  { }.</li>
            <li>Semicolons: As you may have noticed by now, each statement in the above code is followed by a ( ; ) semicolon symbol. It is used to terminate each line of the statement of the program.</li>
            <li>Identifiers: We use identifiers for the naming of variables, functions, and other user-defined data types. An identifier may consist of uppercase and lowercase alphabetical characters, underscore, and digits. The first letter must be an underscore or an alphabet.</li>
            <li>Keywords: In the C++ programming language, there are some reserved words that are used for some special meaning in the C++ program. It can't be used for identifiers. For example, the words int, return, and using are some keywords used in our program.</li>
            <li>Basic Output cout: In line #7, we have used the cout stream object (declared in the <iostream> header file) to print the sum of two numbers to the standard output stream (stdout).</li>
            <li>Comments: You can see in the code there are two forward slashes (//) with some text, which are known as comments in a C++ program. Comments provide information about the code or a specific line of code to improve readability.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Basic terminologies of Trees</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Parent Node: The node which is an immediate predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent node of {D, E}.</li>
            <li>Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: {D, E} are the child nodes of {B}.</li>
            <li>Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node. {A} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.</li>
            <li>Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {I, J, K, F, G, H} are the leaf nodes of the tree.</li>
            <li>Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node. {A,B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}</li>

        <!-- Graph -->
         <section id="five">
         <h2>Introduction to Graph</h2>
          <h3>What is Graph</h3>
          <p>Graph is a non-linear data structure like tree data structure. The limitation of tree is, it can only represent hierarchical data. For situations where nodes or vertices are randomly connected with each other other, we use Graph. Example situations where we use graph data structure are, a social network, a computer network, a network of locations used in GPS and many more examples where different nodes or vertices are connected without any hierarchic or constraint on structure.</p>
          <img src="./Graphs.webp" alt="Graph img">
          <h3>Basic terminologies of Graph</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Graph: A Graph G is a non-empty set of vertices (or nodes) V and a set of edges E, where each edge connects a pair of vertices. Formally, a graph can be represented as G= (V, E). Graphs can be classified based on various properties, such as directedness of edges and connectivity.</li>
            <li>Vertex (Node): A Vertex, often referred to as a Node, is a fundamental unit of a graph. It represents an entity within the graph. In applications like social networks, vertices can represent individuals, while in road networks, they can represent intersections or locations.</li>
            <li>Edge: An Edge is a connection between two vertices in a graph. It can be either directed or undirected. In a directed graph, edges have a specific direction, indicating a one-way connection between vertices. In contrast, undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction and represent bidirectional connections.</li>
            <li>Degree of a Vertex: The Degree of a Vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to that vertex. In a directed graph, the degree is further categorized into the in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges) of the vertex.</li>
            <li>Path: A Path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. Paths can be of varying lengths and may or may not visit the same vertex more than once. The shortest path between two vertices is of particular interest in algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.</li>
            <li>Cycle: A Cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repetitions of vertices (except the starting and ending vertex, which are the same). Cycles are essential in understanding the connectivity and structure of a graph and play a significant role in cycle detection algorithms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Types of Graph</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Finite Graphs: A graph is said to be finite if it has a finite number of vertices and a finite number of edges. A finite graph is a graph with a finite number of vertices and edges. In other words, both the number of vertices and the number of edges in a finite graph are limited and can be counted. Finite graphs are used to represent real-world situations where there are a limited number of objects and their connections. They help in organizing, analyzing, and optimizing relationships in different applications.</li>
            <li>Infinite Graph: A graph is called an infinite graph if it has an infinite number of vertices and an infinite number of edges. Unlike finite graphs, which have a fixed number of nodes and connections, infinite graphs extend indefinitely.</li>
            <li>Trivial Graph: A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge. A trivial graph is a graph with only one vertex and no edges. It is also known as a singleton graph or a single vertex graph. A trivial graph is the simplest type of graph and is often used as a starting point for building more complex graphs. In graph theory, trivial graphs are considered to be a degenerate case and are not typically studied in detail</li>
            <li>Simple Graph: A simple graph is a graph that does not contain more than one edge between the pair of vertices. A simple railway track connecting different cities is an example of a simple graph.</li>
            <li>Multi Graph: Any graph which contains some parallel edges but doesn't contain any self-loop is called a multigraph. For example a Road Map.
                <ul>
                    <li>Parallel Edges: If two vertices are connected with more than one edge then such edges are called parallel edges that are many routes but one destination.</li>
                    <li>Loop: An edge of a graph that starts from a vertex and ends at the same vertex is called a loop or a self-loop.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
